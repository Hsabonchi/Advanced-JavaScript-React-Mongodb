<h2> MongoDB Server </h2>
<ul>
<li> A collection is the equivalent of a table in relational databases </li>
<li>Collection does notenforce a schema </li>
<li> Documents in MongoDB are objects stored in a format called BSON </li> 
<li> Each document must have a unique _id field that serves as the primary key </li>
<li> The value of _idcan be user-assigned (of any type) or auto-generated. </li>
<li> An Object value is also known as an embedded documentor a sub-document </li>
</ul>

<h3>What is BSON? </h3>
<ul> 
  <li>BSON simply stands for “Binary JSON </li>
  <li> BSON’s binary structure encodes type and length information, which allows it to be parsed much more quickly. </li>
  <li>MongoDB stores data in BSON </li>
  <li> allows developers to query and manipulate objects by specific keys inside the JSON/BSON document</li>
</ul>
