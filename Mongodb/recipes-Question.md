 Arecipe, like General Tso's Cauliflower (Links to an external site.), 
 has a name, yield (i.e. number of servings), a number of ingredients, 
 and directions (which consist of a number of steps). 
 Note that quantity needs to be specified for some ingredients (e.g. 2 teaspoons of oil) but not for the others (e.g. salt).
 
**please create a Node.js program that does the following:** 
* Create two recipes objects. You may hard-code a couple of simple, make-up recipes 
    ** they don't need to be complex or real, but they should have all the properties described above.
* Query the database for recipes that use the ingredients "beef" and "potato". Print out the id and name of the recipes found.
* Query the database for recipes whose names include the word "Steak". 
* Print out the id and name of the recipes found. You must use Text Search for this query. 
* You can create the necessary text index outside the program.
